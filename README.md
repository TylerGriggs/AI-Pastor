RNN with custom input sermon text over two years.
Multi-layer Recurrent Neural Networks (LSTM, RNN) for word-level language models in Python using TensorFlow.

Mostly reused code from https://github.com/sherjilozair/char-rnn-tensorflow which was inspired from Andrej Karpathy's [char-rnn](https://github.com/karpathy/char-rnn).

# Requirements
- [Tensorflow 1.1.0rc0](http://www.tensorflow.org)
